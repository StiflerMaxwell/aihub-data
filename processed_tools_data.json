      "Overly Aggressive Content Filters (Safety Model): Character AI employs a notoriously strict 'safety model' that frequently censors or blocks conversations, even those not explicitly sexual or violent, hindering creative freedom and causing significant frustration for users attempting to explore mature themes, complex narratives, or realistic human interactions.",
      "Occasional Inconsistency & 'Out-of-Character' Behavior: Despite impressive capabilities, characters can sometimes 'hallucinate,' forget established facts, or act inconsistently with their defined persona or the ongoing narrative, breaking immersion and requiring users to constantly re-roll responses or provide explicit guidance to steer the conversation back on track."

      {
        "question": "What is Character AI?",
        "answer": "Character AI is an advanced AI chatbot platform that allows users to create, interact with, and discover AI characters. These characters can be based on fictional personas, historical figures, celebrities, or completely original creations. It uses large language models (LLMs) to generate human-like text responses, enabling users to engage in realistic conversations, role-playing scenarios, and creative storytelling with their chosen or self-designed AI companions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I use Character AI?",
        "answer": "To use Character AI, you typically start by visiting their website or app and creating an account. You can then explore a vast library of pre-existing characters created by the community or Character AI itself. To interact, simply select a character and begin typing your messages in the chat interface. If you wish to create your own character, there's usually a 'Create' option where you define the character's name, description, personality traits, and provide example dialogue to 'train' the AI. You can also give feedback on the AI's responses (e.g., by rating or swiping for alternatives) to help refine its behavior."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Character AI free?",
        "answer": "Yes, Character AI offers a free tier that allows users to create characters and chat with them without any cost. However, during peak usage times, free users might experience wait times due to high demand. For an enhanced experience, Character AI offers a paid subscription called 'Character AI+' (C.AI+). This premium service provides benefits such as faster response times, no wait queues, early access to new features, and potentially higher message limits or dedicated servers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the main features?",

      },
      {
